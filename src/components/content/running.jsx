        One of my favorite hobbies is to run. It&apos;s my favorite way
        to de-stress and get some exercise. There&apos;s nothing like that good
        feeling you get right after finishing a tough training run or
        crossing the finish line of a race.  My family has inspired me to improve at
        running, as my mom is a world-class marathoner and triathlete,
        and my grandparents still participate in road races and
        triathlons at an age where most people are unable to exercise much at all.

        I most enjoy running longer distances, and my biggest dream is to one day
        finish the Boston Marathon. Though of course, I&apos;m looking forward to
        hopefully traveling to and pariticpating in lots of cool races around the world.
